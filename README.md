Match the squares to raise your score and combine them! What's the highest score you can get?
Use your arrow keys to move all squares by one in that direction.

## Behind the game

This game was made with the fun and easy to use [bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)! I built this to become
more familiar with ECS systems in general but also game programming. (This is my first 'released' game after all!)

## Running the Game

Simply clone this repository and run `cargo run --release` to play this game.
